Members: Hanna Albright, Illya Garashchenko, Katherine Kuenster

Bugs/Missing Features:
• Ray generation in perspective view
    •There is a file called rayCaster from Illya, who was in charge of this part, but it doesn't use the starter code or have a way to implement      this with the rest of the code.
    • I added a version (in the RayTracer.h/.cpp files) to prove that I can create a scene from a given file and do the collisions properly
• Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting from multiple point lights. 

Collaborators:
•Sphere and plane collision
  •Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with C++ by Scott Gordon and John Clevenger
