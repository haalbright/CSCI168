A list of team member names 
• A list of all known bugs and missing features 
• A list of all minimal extra features stating who the main contributors were for each (without this list, I will 
not award any credit). It is appropriate to list one OR more members for each feature.  
Example: Reading a scene from an external file: Jory and Pippin 
• A  list  of  collaborators  and  outside  resources.  This includes  collaboration  through  online  forums,  e.g., if 
you asked a question on stackoverflow. Be sure to cite sources again in the assignment body, e.g., copy 
website link into code. Do not list Dr. Jory as a collaborator -- this is assumed.

I certify that I have listed above all the sources that I consulted regarding this assignment, and that I have
